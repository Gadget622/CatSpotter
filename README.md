# Cat Spotter
This repository aims to train a model that is really really good at seeing the difference between a cat and a dog.

This repository is part of a workshop I gave for RSO D.R.E.A.M. at Minnesota State University, Mankato.

# This project is in active development right now.

## What does this mean?
- A more precise README file will be added at a different time
- Model results will be posted when a model is trained
- Version control when a model is improved will be added in the near future

Please hang around to see the progress on this repository!
